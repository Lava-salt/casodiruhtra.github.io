        <h2>What is CaSoDiRuHTra?</h2>
        <p>
            CaSoDiRuHTra means <strong style="color:red;">C</strong>ar <strong style="color:red;">So</strong>cial <strong style="color:red;">D</strong>istance <strong style="color:red;">Ru</strong>le for <strong style="color:red;">H</strong>eavy <strong style="color:red;">Tra</strong>ffic,
            which is a rule that you can apply to make automobile traffic go faster. It relies on a set of rules:
        </p>
        <h3>Rule #0</h3>
        <p>CaSoDiRuHTra's rules are only applied when the automobile traffic is slow, boring and reminds people of <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iQyAjuS5Uzc8/v1/-1x-1.webp">this</a>.</p>
        <h3>Rule #1</h3>
        <p>All cars (applying CaSoDiRuHTra) must social distance each other. They'll social distance the cars on their back/front, but not on their left/right*. <br/>
        *Cars on their left/right don't affect the traffic flow (except they change lanes).</p>
        <h3>Rule #2</h3>
        <p>Changing road lanes is <strong>prohibited</strong> when applying CaSoDiRuHTra, because doing this is a big reason of heavy traffic. <br/>
        This includes road crossing slowly or jaywalking, hitchhiking a lot, and driving distractedly*. <br/>
        *Interacting with devices that make you not look at the road while driving, such as cellular telephones or books. <br/>
        NOTE: The prohibits are ignored when necessary (e.g. a car accident/construction's on your lane.)</p>
        <h3>Rule #3</h3>
        <p>The social distance of Rule #1 can change according to the road type/length/width/density, so the distance will be chosen by CaSoDiRuHTra appliers. This is valid unless these happen: <br/>
        1. The distance is so short that the CaSoDiRuHTra cars look <strong>almost</strong> identical to ordinary cars. <br/>
        2. The distance is so long that cars crossing that time it takes for cars to cross that distance is longer than time they spend on what'd happen without CaSoDiRuHTra. <br/>
        3. The distance is suspiciously long/short that people question it, you and CaSoDiRuHTra.</p>
        <h3>Rule #4</h3>
        <p>While applying Rule #1 of CaSoDiRuHTra, if someone honks you, you must move forward if they don't know CaSoDiRuHTra. You can understand this by the popularity of CaSoDiRuHTra at that time.</p>
        <h2>Why does it make traffic flow faster?</h2>
        <p>In a lane where CaSoDiRuHTra isn't applied, and the traffic is heavy, this would be the flow: <br/>
        1. A car moves forward. <br/>
        2. The car behind it waits 2-5 seconds (to not crash into that because they're so close) <br/>
        3. It moves forward, and it returns to 2. step. <br/>
        So in a 1-lane heavy traffic with 10 cars, the back car needs to wait 20-50 seconds to move. <br/>
        But in a lane where CaSoDiRuHTra is applied, and the traffic is heavy, this would be the flow: <br/>
        1. A car moves forward. <br/>
        2. The car behind it starts moving forward (because they have so much distance so they can't crash.) <br/>
        3. Both cars social distance each other so CaSoDiRuHTra continues, and it returns to 2. step.. <br/>
        So in a 1-lane heavy traffic with 10 cars, the back car needs to wait ([average human's reaction time] x 10) seconds to move.</p>
        <h3>Python Implementation</h3>
        <p>I implemented CaSoDiRuHTra vs Non-CaSoDiRuHTra traffic flow in Python. Here is <a href="https://github.com/Lava-salt/casodiruhtra.github.io/raw/refs/heads/main/main.py">that code</a> (Works in VS-Code but not PyCharm):</p>
        <h3>Downsides</h3>
        <p>-People may not understand it because it could be too complicated for them. <br/>
        - People may not use it because they don't think "social distancing" cars in traffic would work. <br/>
        - People won't know it because it's not that popular yet.</p>
